Chilean Fires Dashboard is an application to see real-time wildfires and forecast places that have the highest likelihood of fire.

You need to create a app/secret.js file with the following data:

```
export const mapboxStyleUrl = 'mapbox://styles/sebastiantare/clqk4x12t00fo01qu0wdw0860';
export const mapboxAccessToken = 'your_mapbox_token';
```
